## Project Overview
This project is a multi-page Dash web app that helps users explore food and drink options interactively.  
- **Problem**: People often want inspiration for meals with ingredients they already have at home, or they want to discover local breweries in their city. However, finding this information usually requires searching multiple websites.  
- **Audience**: Everyday cooks, food enthusiasts, and anyone interested in exploring nearby breweries.  
- **Value**: The app combines recipe suggestions and brewery search in one convenient, user-friendly interface. It reduces time spent searching, helps reduce food waste by using existing ingredients, and connects users with local breweries.

The app has three sections:
1. **Home Page** ‚Äì Overview and navigation.  
2. **Recipes Page** ‚Äì Input an ingredient to see a list of recipes.
3. **Breweries Page** ‚Äì Enter a city to view breweries nearby, along with interactive visualizations.

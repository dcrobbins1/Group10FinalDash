# Food & Drinks Explorer

## Project Overview
This project is a multi-page Dash web app that helps users explore food and drink options interactively.  
- **Problem**: People often want inspiration for meals with ingredients they already have at home, or they want to discover local breweries in their city. However, finding this information usually requires searching multiple websites.  
- **Audience**: Everyday cooks, food enthusiasts, and anyone interested in exploring nearby breweries.  
- **Value**: The app combines recipe suggestions and brewery search in one convenient, user-friendly interface. It reduces time spent searching, helps reduce food waste by using existing ingredients, and connects users with local breweries.

The app has three sections:
1. **Home Page** – Overview and navigation.  
2. **Recipes Page** – Input an ingredient to see a list of recipes.
3. **Breweries Page** – Enter a city to view breweries nearby, along with interactive visualizations.  


## AI Statement:
Generative AI (ChatGPT) was used to assist with:
- Brainstorming the overall structure and layout of the multi-page Dash app
- Writing callbacks for recipe search and nutrition chart functionality
- Designing helper functions to fetch and process API data
- Formatting page layouts and styling with Dash/Bootstrap components
- Troubleshooting import and page routing issues
All code was reviewed, tested, and modified by the team to ensure correctness and understanding.
